<h1>3. The Number of Players<a class="headerlink" href="#the-number-of-players" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>

<p>Players not capable of play (e.g. players not able to walk on two legs, players not able to stand, or players with obvious malfunctions) are not permitted to participate in the game.
They must be removed from the field.
It is up to the referee to judge whether a player is capable of play.
The referee may ask the team leader of a player suspected to be incapable of play to demonstrate playing ability at any time.
A field player that is not able to get back into a stable standing or walking posture from a fall within 20 seconds will be removed from the field for 30 seconds removal penalty and has to reenter the field according to 5.9.</p>

<p>Up to two players per game can be substituted by other players of the same team.
The referee must be informed prior to the substitution.
A substitute only enters the field after the player being replaced left the field and after receiving a signal from the referee.
Any of the other players may change places with the goalkeeper, provided that the referee is informed before the change is made and that the change is made during a stoppage of the match.
Exchanging a field player with a goalie does not count as substitution.
Changing places/roles between a field player and a goalie does not count as substitution.</p>
